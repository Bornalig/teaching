# Goal
- Gain intuition for different notions of similarity and practice finding similar documents.
- Explore the tradeoffs with representing documents using raw word counts and TF-IDF
- Explore the behavior of different distance metrics by looking at the Wikipedia pages most similar to President Obamaâ€™s page.

# Snapshot
- **Recommend** open `md` file inside a file
- open `.html` file via brower for quick look.
# Algorithm
- K-NN with word count and tf-idf
- metrics differ from Euclidean and Cosine
# Implement in details
- Extract word count vectors
- Find nearest neighbors using word count vectors
- Interpreting the nearest neighbors
- Extract the TF-IDF vectors
- Find nearest neighbors using TF-IDF vectors
- Choosing metrics
- Problem with cosine distances: tweets vs. long articles
