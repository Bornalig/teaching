# Implementing Locality Sensitive Hashing from scratch
# Goal
- Implement the LSH algorithm for approximate nearest neighbor search
- Examine the accuracy for different documents by comparing against brute force search, and also contrast runtimes
- Explore the role of the algorithmâ€™s tuning parameters in the accuracy of the method

# Algorithm
Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) 
# Implement in details
- Extract the TF-IDF vectors
- Train an LSH model
- Inspect bins
- Query the LSH model
- Experimenting with your LSH implementation
- Effect of nearby bin search
- Quality metrics for neighbors
- Effect of number of random vectors
